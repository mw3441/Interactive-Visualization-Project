# Interactive-Visualization-Project
Interactive visualization is becoming a more prominent feature of reporting. Business analytics packages tend to stress the ease with which data can be played with by non-experts. Allowing students to explore aspects of complex data rather than simply telling them what you see can be a powerful tool for learning as explored in the readings. Within the RStudio universe this functionality is accomplished through the Shiny ecosystem. A web-app designing interface that allows web-apps to be built from within R with limited knowledge of javascript or html.

In this project, we would go through the step to visualize the midterm results by shiny app.
